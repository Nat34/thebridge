# The Bridge
Server-Side Topics: JavaScript Objects, JSON and AJAX

This folder contains practice files.  These files are created while learning to use server-side technologies like JavaScript objects, JSON(JavaScript Object Notation), and AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). These technologies act as the "bridge" between client and server. HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in use were created for [Structure-HTML](https://github.com/Nat34/Structure-HTML.git),[Style-CSS](https://github.com/Nat34/Style-CSS.git), [Interactivity-JavaScript](https://github.com/Nat34/Interactivity-JavaScript.git) projects.
